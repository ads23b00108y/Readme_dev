### **2. Code Architecture Updates**

#### **Book Provider Enhanced:**
```dart
// NEW: Enhanced Book model with real cover support
class Book {
  final String? coverImageUrl;  // Real cover from Open Library
  final String? coverEmoji;     // Emoji fallback
  
  // Smart cover detection
  bool get hasRealCover => coverImageUrl != null && 
                          coverImageUrl!.isNotEmpty && 
                          coverImageUrl!.startsWith('http');
}
```

#### **UI Components Upgraded:**
```dart
// NEW: CachedNetworkImage for smooth loading
CachedNetworkImage(
  imageUrl: book.coverImageUrl!,
  fit: BoxFit.cover,
  placeholder: (context, url) => LoadingIndicator(),
