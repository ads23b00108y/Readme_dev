# PDF Book Upload and Viewing Feature Guide

## Overview
The ReadMe app now supports uploading and reading PDF books alongside traditional text-based content. This feature integrates seamlessly with existing functionality including TTS, progress tracking, and user sessions.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Dependencies Added (pubspec.yaml)
- `file_picker: ^6.1.1` - For selecting PDF files from device
- `syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer: ^24.1.41` - For rendering PDF documents
- `syncfusion_flutter_pdf: ^24.1.41` - For extracting text from PDFs
- `path_provider: ^2.1.1` - For file path management

### 2. Book Model Updates (lib/providers/book_provider.dart)
Added two new fields to the Book class:
- `String? pdfPath` - Stores the local file path to the PDF
- `bool isPdf` - Indicates whether the book is a PDF (default: false)

Both fields are:
- Included in the `Book` constructor
- Handled in `fromFirestore` factory method
- Serialized in `toMap` method

### 3. Reading Screen Enhancements (lib/screens/book/reading_screen.dart)

#### New State Variables
```dart
bool _isPdfBook = false;
String? _pdfPath;
PdfViewerController? _pdfController;
PdfDocument? _pdfDocument;
String _currentPageText = '';
bool _isExtractingText = false;
```

#### Key Methods Added/Modified

**_uploadPdfFile()** - NEW
- Opens file picker for PDF selection
- Validates file size (max 50MB)
- Loads PDF and displays success/error messages
- Comprehensive error handling

**_loadPdfBook(String pdfPath)** - NEW
- Validates PDF file exists and is readable
- Loads PDF document using Syncfusion
- Initializes PDF viewer controller
- Extracts text from first page
- Restores reading progress if available

**_extractTextFromCurrentPage()** - NEW
- Extracts text from current PDF page
- Uses PdfTextExtractor from Syncfusion
- Stores extracted text in `_currentPageText` for TTS
- Handles extraction errors gracefully

**_loadBookContent()** - MODIFIED
- Checks if book is PDF or text-based
- Routes to appropriate loading method
- Maintains backward compatibility

**_togglePlayPause()** - MODIFIED
- Uses extracted text for TTS when viewing PDF
- Falls back to page content for text books
- Validates text availability before speaking

**_nextPage() / _previousPage()** - MODIFIED
- Jumps PDF viewer to correct page when PDF
- Extracts text from new page
- Updates progress tracking
- Maintains chapter info for text books

**dispose()** - MODIFIED
- Properly disposes of PDF document resources
- Prevents memory leaks

#### UI Updates

**Header Section**
- Added upload button (ðŸ“¤ icon) when not viewing PDF
- Button triggers file picker for PDF selection
- Only visible for non-PDF books to allow switching

**Content Area**
- Conditional rendering:
  - Shows `SfPdfViewer.file()` for PDF books
  - Shows traditional text scroll view for text books
- PDF viewer includes:
  - Page change callback for progress tracking
  - Automatic text extraction on page change
  - Same styling and shadow effects

**Error Screen**
- Added "Try Another PDF" button
- Allows recovery from PDF loading errors
- Maintains existing "Go Back" option

## User Experience Flow

### Reading Text-Based Books
1. User opens book from library
2. Traditional reading interface loads
3. Upload button available in header
4. User can upload PDF to switch to PDF mode

### Uploading a PDF
1. User clicks upload button (ðŸ“¤)
2. File picker opens with PDF filter
3. User selects PDF file
4. App validates file (size, format, validity)
5. PDF loads in viewer if valid
6. Text extracted from first page
7. Success message shown

### Reading PDF Books
1. PDF renders in Syncfusion viewer
2. User can swipe/tap to navigate pages
3. Progress tracked automatically
4. TTS uses extracted text from current page
5. All standard controls available (play, next, previous)
6. Font size controls disabled (native PDF rendering)

### Error Handling
- Invalid file format â†’ Error message with retry option
- File too large (>50MB) â†’ Size limit error
- Corrupted PDF â†’ Invalid file error
- Missing file â†’ File not found error
- Text extraction fails â†’ TTS disabled with message

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- 50MB file size limit prevents memory issues
- Lazy loading of PDF pages
- Text extraction on-demand per page
- Proper resource disposal

### Compatibility
- Maintains full backward compatibility
- Existing books work unchanged
- Progress tracking works for both types
- TTS available for both formats

### Storage
- PDFs stored locally on device
- Path stored in Book model
- Not uploaded to Firebase (would require cloud storage setup)
- Temporary session-based for demo

### Future Enhancements
- Cloud storage integration for PDF persistence
- PDF caching for faster loading
- Bookmark support for PDFs
- Annotation capabilities
- PDF search functionality
- Thumbnail previews

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Extract text from PDF pages
- [ ] Play TTS with extracted text

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Page progress updates correctly
- [ ] Progress persists across sessions
- [ ] Completion tracking works
- [ ] Reading time tracked accurately

### Error Handling
- [ ] Large file rejection (>50MB)
- [ ] Invalid PDF rejection
- [ ] Corrupted PDF handling
- [ ] Missing file handling
- [ ] Text extraction failures

### Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Text books still work

## Code Quality

### Best Practices Followed
âœ… Minimal changes to existing code
âœ… Backward compatibility maintained
âœ… Proper error handling
âœ… Resource cleanup (dispose)
âœ… User feedback (snackbars, messages)
âœ… Type safety
âœ… Null safety
âœ… Async/await patterns
âœ… State management

### Documentation
âœ… Code comments for new features
âœ… README updated
âœ… This feature guide created
âœ… Clear variable naming

## Known Limitations

1. **PDF Storage**: Currently session-based only. Requires cloud storage setup for persistence.
2. **File Size**: 50MB limit may exclude some academic textbooks or image-heavy books.
3. **Text Extraction**: May fail for scanned PDFs without OCR.
4. **Font Customization**: Not available for PDFs (native rendering).
5. **Search**: Full-text search not yet implemented.

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- No changes required
- All existing books continue to work
- New PDF feature is opt-in via upload button

### For New Deployments
- Add dependencies via `flutter pub get`
- No database migration needed
- Book model backward compatible
- Firebase rules unchanged
