## 🏃‍♂️ **How to Run the Script**

### **Prerequisites**
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Your `serviceAccountKey.json` is in the `tools/` folder
3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
cd tools
npm install firebase-admin node-fetch
```

### **Step 1: Clear Existing Books (Optional)**
If you want to start fresh, uncomment this line in the script:
```javascript
// await clearExistingBooks();
```

### **Step 2: Run the Upload Script**
```bash
cd tools

✅ Uploaded: "Where the Wild Things Are" by Maurice Sendak (children)
...
🎉 Upload complete! Total books uploaded: 120
```

## 📋 **Book Format Created**

Each book will have this structure (perfect for your Flutter app):

```json
{
  "title": "The Very Hungry Caterpillar",
  "author": "Eric Carle",
  "description": "A story about a caterpillar's transformation...",
  "coverEmoji": "🐾🌟",
  "traits": ["curious", "imaginative"],
  "ageRating": "6+",
  "estimatedReadingTime": 8,
  "content": [
    "Once upon a time, there was a tiny caterpillar...",
    "The caterpillar was very hungry and started to eat...",
    "After eating so much, the caterpillar built a cocoon..."
  ],
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "source": "Open Library",
  "subject": "animals"
}
```

## 🎨 **Personality Traits Mapping**

Books are automatically tagged with traits for your recommendation system:

- **Adventure books** → `['adventurous', 'brave', 'curious']`
- **Animal stories** → `['kind', 'curious', 'caring']`
- **Fairy tales** → `['imaginative', 'creative', 'kind']`
- **Friendship stories** → `['kind', 'friendly', 'caring']`
- **Fantasy books** → `['imaginative', 'creative', 'adventurous']`

## 🔧 **Customization Options**

### **Add More Subjects**
Edit the `subjects` array to include more categories:
```javascript
const subjects = [
  'children',
  'science',      // Add science books
  'history',      // Add history books
  'mystery'       // Add mystery books
];
```

### **Adjust Book Limits**
Change the number of books per subject:
```javascript
const url = `https://openlibrary.org/subjects/${subject}.json?limit=25&details=true`;
```

### **Modify Age Ratings**
Update age ratings based on subject:
```javascript
const ageRating = subject === 'picture_books' ? '3+' : '6+';
```
