# Git Push Issue - Fix Guide

## Current Situation

Based on `git status`, you have:
- ✅ 1 commit ahead of origin/main
- ⚠️ Many unstaged changes (deletions and modifications)
- ⚠️ Untracked new files

## Common "Can't Push Refs" Errors & Solutions

### **Error 1: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally"**

**Solution: Pull first, then push**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\loisf\Desktop\readme3\Readme_dev

# Pull remote changes
git pull origin main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge remote changes"

# Now push
git push origin main
```

---

### **Error 2: "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind"**

**Solution: Pull with rebase**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\loisf\Desktop\readme3\Readme_dev

# Pull and rebase
git pull --rebase origin main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them, then:
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Push
git push origin main
```

---

### **Error 3: "Failed to push some refs" (force push needed)**

**Solution: Force push (⚠️ Use with caution)**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\loisf\Desktop\readme3\Readme_dev

# Force push (overwrites remote)
git push -f origin main
```

---

## Recommended Steps (Safe Approach)

### **Step 1: Stage All Changes**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\loisf\Desktop\readme3\Readme_dev

# Add all changes (including deletions)
git add -A

# Check what will be committed
git status
```

### **Step 2: Commit Changes**
```powershell
# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Major cleanup: Remove unused files, fix PDF viewer, update progress tracking"
```

### **Step 3: Pull Remote Changes**
```powershell
# Pull to sync with remote
git pull origin main
```

### **Step 4: Push to Remote**
```powershell
# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

---

## If You Get Merge Conflicts

### **Resolve Conflicts:**
```powershell
# After git pull shows conflicts:

# 1. Open conflicted files in VS Code
# 2. Choose which changes to keep
# 3. Save the files
# 4. Stage resolved files
git add .

# 5. Complete the merge
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"

# 6. Push
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Create New Branch

If you want to be extra safe:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\loisf\Desktop\readme3\Readme_dev

# Create new branch with your changes
git checkout -b cleanup-and-fixes

# Stage and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Major cleanup: Remove unused files, fix PDF viewer, update progress tracking"

# Push new branch
git push origin cleanup-and-fixes

# Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

---

## Quick Fix (Most Common Solution)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\loisf\Desktop\readme3\Readme_dev

# Stage everything
git add -A

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix: Remove unused files and update PDF viewer"

# Pull remote changes
git pull origin main --no-rebase

# Push
git push origin main
```

---

## Check Remote URL

Make sure your remote is set correctly:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\loisf\Desktop\readme3\Readme_dev

# Check remote
git remote -v

# Should show something like:
# origin  https://github.com/yourusername/readme-app.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/yourusername/readme-app.git (push)
```

If remote is wrong:
```powershell
# Set correct remote
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/readme-app.git
```

---

## Authentication Issues

If you get authentication errors:

### **Option 1: Use Personal Access Token**
```powershell
# When prompted for password, use your GitHub Personal Access Token
# Get token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

### **Option 2: Use GitHub CLI**
```powershell
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
# Then authenticate
gh auth login

# Push using gh
gh repo sync
```
